## Description

Foodbook is a web app, that connects the best from two entirely different worlds - food delivery apps and social media, enabling these two aspects to accelerate each other and truly thrive. The user can see their friends' posts and photos of recently ordered food, get inspired to buy similar dishes and maybe reward them with our special pizza icon. As the posts are directly connected to the restaurants where the food was ordered it is extremely easy to immediately order your own meal - with just a click of a “house” button. Additionally the whole website utilises tags on the right side of the screen. If a user clicks on one of them all the places tagged with it are shown. Additional feature that will increase the chance of the user ordering something is the counter, that tells how many times a certain item was recently ordered. The site could be further expanded by adding rest of the features that we have planned, but didn’t have enough time to develop - sorting system, restaurant rating, placing popular posts directly at restaurants profile etc.
Tagging friends in the posts would certainly encourage people to eat and hang out together (which is beneficial both for the users and the restaurant). The site enables the users to choose the precise hour of delivery - in further development we wanted to implement a functionality that would allow the deliverer to notify if they were coming near. Another feature that was yet to be developed is direct connection to the GPS and clock, updated in real-time, both of which would make it much easier to get prepared for eating. Last feature that we wanted to implement (but again - didn’t have time to, as we were quite busy during Easter time) is rating the restaurants in different categories - [quality of delivery, quality of serving, taste and time].
Although we would recommend our app to all sorts of users, our main target are the social media users, who should really feel welcome on our website. Another group that would benefit from our site are small and medium communities, who could hang out together for different dishes.



## Prototype

*Describe the basic functionality of your prototype. What are the features you were able to implement? What features would you like to implement?*

The basic functionality of our prototype is mixing social media and food ordering site together to give users better expiernce and let them easily order what their friend ate today. We were able to implement “social media”-like posts with food pictures ordered from restaurants. Beside standard like icon, we were able to implement straight link to restaurant from which food was ordered. We would like to more deeply integrate ‘social media’-like site by letting users give better opinions about restaurants.

## Challenges and accomplishments

*Is there anything unexpected that you learned over the course of this project?*

We learned that integrating social media into food ordering app is harder, but gives better user experience and should result in higher sale.

*Is there something your team is particularly proud of, related to this project?*

What we are most proud of is the whole concept of connecting social media with food delivery app. It’s something fresh and we have not seen such a solution anywhere and, after talking with our friends - it really is something that might stir quite a lot of attention.

## Next steps

*What do you need to do next to turn this prototype into a working solution?*

To turn our prototype into a full working solution ready to go on production the most important thing is to change how data is stored by our app. We stored it in a file, but in working solution it should store data in the database. Second most important thing is to implement payment methods and account registration protection.
